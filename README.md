# coding-best-practices
* Why do we need to read this?
    * You are a programmer. Good. Best practices would help you become better
* The focus is on "readability" and "simplicity" and follow a "least surprise" approach
* A lot of people can write code that machines can interpret. Good programmers can write code that fellow engineers can understand and interpret easily
* The productivy decreases exponentially over time, with bad code
* If you look at messy code and recognize if its messy, and do not know what to do with it? Idea is to present some guidelines to make refactoring easier.
* While refactoring, we can apply the Boy Scout rule - "Leave the campground cleaner than you found it!"
