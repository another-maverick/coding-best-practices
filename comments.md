# Comments
* Comments are extremely useful. However there are cases where they are useless, especially when the code is able to express the intent(which is) the right way)
* Always think when writing  comments - can you express yourself using code? If yes, no need of comment
* Sometimes comments can be used to explain the intent of the code. For example "this is the best effort to prevent a functional error condition"
* When you wnat to warn of the consequences. example  "running this function would kill the proccess. Use it with caution" etc.
* **TODO** comments - refactoring or things that the programmer intends to do. Several IDE's support this type of comments.
* **GoDocs** etc. are based  out of comments
* Avoid bad and misleading comments
* We should not add comments like "I changed this on xyz date etc.". Changes etc. are better manged in GIT
* **Commented out Code** is bad!. Go ahead and delete it
