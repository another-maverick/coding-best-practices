# Clean Design

## Runs all the tests
* How do we know our system is working as designed? Using *Tests*
* When we write more and more tests,  we indirectly push code that is being tested to follow right principles

## Refactor and simplify
* Running  tests gives us the confidence to refactor without worrying about breaking stuff
* things like choosing better names, modularize, decoupling, applying SRP etc. are all examples of what can be refactored

## Reduce Duplication
* Remove un-necessary code
* Check classes to understand if there are un-necessary methods? Idea is to express more and talk less

## Express well
* It is important that others understand the code that we are writing. **Keep It Simple**
