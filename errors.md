# Errors
* If there is no proper **Error Handling**, it is very hard to find out what the code does
* Caller must understand what kind of errors does the code throws
* Use **try-catch-finally** block for exception handling. That way, you get a chance to show what happens, no matter what
* Create **informative error messages**
*
