# Naming
* Use meaningful names. Dont use incremental variables like a1, a2, a3 etc.They dont provide any information
* Use names that you can pronounce
* prefixes are okay. Just be consistent
* Single letter names like "i" can only be used for local variables and when the scope is very limited
* Length  of a variable name should correspond to the size of the scope
* **Class names should be noun** like "Manager", "Customer"
* **Method Names should be verbs** like "getSalary()". Normally prefixed with **get,  set, is** etc
* Dont add "clever" names. example: dont use whack() to represent kill()
* Be **consistent**. For example, fetch, get and retrieve all mean the same thing. Be consistent with the choice.
* While consistency is  important, sometimes we need to use "add" and "insert" in different areas, even though they sound similar. Adding two integers vs inserting something to a DB
* If you are using a well known principle or algorithm, you can use keywords prefixes such as "abstract" in the name of abstract class
* Say if you have an application called "Campaign Inventory Tool". Prefixing methods or variables with something like "CIT"  will add a lot of noise. It will make searching harder  and not add any value. Avoid this.
